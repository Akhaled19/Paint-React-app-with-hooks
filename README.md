## Learning React Hooks
Notes from the React Hooks documentation and 

### Introducing React Hooks 
* Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. 
* Hooks don't work inside class components - Hooks allow us to use React without classes
* Hooks are not build to replace classes. There are no plans to remove classes from React
* Hooks don't replace your knowledge of React concepts. Instead, Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: **props, context, refs, and lifecycles**  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
